Visualizes Graph Algorithms -> Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path.

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, I implemented a **Recursive Division** Maze Generation algorithm.
